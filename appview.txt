App Overview:
Build Referra, an intelligent referral platform that automates the matching of case managers with pre-vetted service providers. The platform eliminates manual searching, enhances provider visibility, and streamlines the referral process through a dynamic questionnaire. Case managers fill out a referral request form, and the Referra admin team matches providers based on the submitted criteria.


Key features include a Landing Page, Sign-Up/Sign-In, Case Manager Dashboard, Admin Dashboard, Provider Dashboard/Profile, and a Referral Flow with an integrated Questionnaire. Providers have three subscription tiers:


Basic (Free) â€“ Limited visibility, no access to referrals.
Pro (Paid) â€“ Claimed profile with full access to referrals.
Priority (Premium) â€“ Higher-tier subscription, ensuring providers are prioritized and shown first in referral results.
Once a case manager selects a provider, the referral process is triggered, allowing both parties to track and manage the referral flow with real-time status updates.


Referral Flow Overview
Referral Request Submission: Case managers submit a request through the built-in questionnaire.
Matching Process: Referraâ€™s admin team curates matching providers based on the case managerâ€™s needs and sends the results back for review.
Provider Selection: Case managers browse through the recommended providers and select the best fit for their client.
Referral Flow Activation: The selected provider is notified, and the referral officially starts. Both case managers and providers can track the referral status through the platform.
